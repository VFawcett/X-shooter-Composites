VLT/X-shooter composites of red and blue quasars, described in Fawcett+2022

The red and blue composites are the files red_spec.fits and blue_spec.fits, respectively. 

Feel free to download and use, but please cite as Fawcett et al. 2022 https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04139?context=astro-ph

The composites are in rest wavelengths, spanning 2000-9000 Angstroms.
The flux is normalised to 6000 Angstroms.


A movie demonstrating our basic extinction curve fitting approach can be found in dust_extinction_movie.mp4.
Feel free to use this movie in talks, but please cite as Fawcett et al. 2022.
